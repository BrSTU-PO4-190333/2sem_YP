Classification and Prediction
3.1 Defining Classification
We begin the discussion of four major data mining techniques with
classification. Classification is a supervised two-step process. During
the first step, a segment of the dataset, the training set, is used to extract
an accurate model that maps the data of the training set into user
predefined classes (groups). During the second step, the model is used
either to classify any new data tuple or dataset introduced, or to extract
more accurate classification rules. Classification could be defined as:
Classification is the process that finds the common properties among
a set of objects in a dataset and classifies them into different classes,
according to a classification model [Chen et al., 1996]
The core requirements for successful classification are a well-defined
set of classes and a training set of pre-classified examples [Han and Kamber,
2001].
The most popular classification techniques are: a) Bayesian classification,
b) decision trees, and c) neural networks. In the rest of this section
we briefly describe the first two.
3.2 Bayesian Classification
As its name implies, Bayesian classification attempts to assign a sample
x to one of the given classes ci, C2,.., CJV, using a probability model
defined according to the Bayes theorem. The latter calculates the posterior
probability of an event, conditional on some other event [Bretthorst,
1994].
Basic prerequisites for the application of bayesian classification are
[Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991]:
1. Knowledge of the prior probability for each class q.
2. Knowledge of the conditional probability density function.
